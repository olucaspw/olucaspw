## Hi there! 👋
I'm Lucas Azevedo, a computer science student at Universidade Estadual do Ceará (UECE). 
My main interests are Software Engineer and InfoSec. I really am into front-end also, as I have had some experience in graphic design.

## Learning now 👨‍💻
I mostly used Python when starting to code, so the majority of my projects were made with it. At university, I mainly used C, as it was the language that my professor used. Recently, I started learning JavaScript, and I'm looking to learn more about it. In addition, when I was younger, I took a basic Arduino course, but I never studied it again.
